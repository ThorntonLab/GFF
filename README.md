#Intro

GFF files that are the output of taking RNA-seq data through a Trinity/Augustus pipeline.

#Crude method overview
Libraries were made from tissues of adult virgin males and females collected 2-5 days post eclosion.  Carcass and germline tissue libraries were prepped and sequence separately and sequenced in 4-plex using Illumina barcodes.  Further methods are available in Rogers et al. 2014.

#Pipeline

We are working on describing our methods via explicit scripts/examples [here](https://github.com/ThorntonLab/annotation_methods).  That is a work in progress.

To build the GFF files, FASTQ files from all sexes, tissues, and replicates were concatenated before running through our pipeline.
